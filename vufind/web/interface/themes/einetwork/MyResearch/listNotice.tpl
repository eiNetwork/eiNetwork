    <p>With the roll-out of our new catalog, you will still have the ability to place items in lists of your own.  Next to each title is the option to Add to MyLIST, a collection of one, or many, lists you can maintain.  You may also add the same title to any of your lists.  However, due to an end user licensing agreement with our former provider, we are unable to transfer your existing lists in MyDiscoveries to our new system.  If you want to save titles you currently have in a list, please print or make screen shots of these.</p>
    <p>When you add an item to a list, you also have the opportunity to add tags.  Tags let you add your own descriptions to library records to make it easier for you to find items like these again.  Tags are not indexed for searching via the general search box, but if you pull up a record that has a tag on it, you can click on the link to find all the other instances where items have that same tag.</p>
